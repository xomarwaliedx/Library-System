# Library System
### Introduction:
In the digital age, the traditional library system faces challenges in efficiently managing and providing access to a growing collection of resources. The system we are proposing recognizes the need for a modernized library system to enhance user experience, streamline administrative tasks, and adapt to evolving technological trends. This project proposes the development of a comprehensive web-based library system to address these challenges.
### Purpose
The primary goal of this project (problem we are aiming to solve) is to create an intuitive and user-friendly online platform that caters to the needs of both librarians (administrators) and library patrons(users). By leveraging modern technologies, we aim to enhance the overall efficiency, accessibility, and management of library resources, fostering a seamless experience for users and administrators alike.
### Definitions
- Librarians (Admins): Authorized personnel responsible for managing the library system, including adding and updating resources, managing user accounts, and overseeing system operations.
- Users: Library patrons who utilize the system to search for, borrow, and return resources, as well as access additional services such as account management.
- Resources: All the books owned by the library along with all the details of their description, author, price and penalty policies in case of loss, and status
### GOALS

- Improve Accessibility: Create a user-friendly interface that allows patrons to search for and access library resources from any location, promoting inclusivity and convenience.
- Efficient Resource Management: Develop an administrative dashboard for librarians to easily catalog, update, and manage the library's collection, reducing manual workload and minimizing errors.
- User Account Management: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms, enabling patrons to manage their accounts, track borrowing history, and receive personalized recommendations
### Plan
The project will be divided into the following phases:
- Requirements Gathering: Identify specific needs and requirements.
- System Design: Develop a comprehensive system architecture, defining the features and functionalities of both the user and administrative interfaces, and plan the corresponding database design, along with a user friendly interface.
- Development: Utilize modern web development technologies to build the web-based library system, including the frontend, backend, and database.
- Testing: Conduct thorough testing to identify and rectify any bugs or issues, ensuring a stable and reliable system. The tests will be obviously implemented in advance to ensure accurate and unbiased evaluation
### Deliverables
Upon completion of the project, the library will receive:
- A fully functional web-based library system accessible to both librarians and users with incremental development and testing (test cases for each function implemented that could be automatically run to ensure correctness and completeness of the system) clearly shown on github.
- Comprehensive documentation outlining system functionalities and guidelines for usage and clearly describing the following points:
  1) Requirements, Software Process, and Architecture Design
  2) System Modeling (UML diagrams representing the system and detailed description of them)
  3) The functionality chosen to be incrementally developed and its description
  4) Any modification done throughout development different from the initial design
By undertaking this project, we will help the library entity to stay at the forefront of technological advancements, ensuring that its resources are easily accessible and efficiently managed for the benefit of the community it serves.
